                            "The Last Light", a first-person sci-fi runner, made with C# in the Unity
                            Engine. I spent about 4 weeks on the concept and the development itself. Initially, it was
                            an assignment for one of my courses, Unity Game Scripting, but I decided I wanted
                            to take it further and keep working on it after assessment.

                            bachelor. Together with 5 fellow students, we combined our skills, with "The Secrets of Ah
                            Puch"
                            being the end result.

                            I was the only engineer/programmer in this project, together with 3
                            artists and 2 designers. It was made in the GxPEngine, which is a custom engine
                            developed mainly by the teachers, and student feedback continually helps improve it.

                            In the 2nd quartile of the 1st year, we were tasked to recreate an old arcade game, possibly with your own
                            chosen theme.

                            At the time, I was quite intrigued by the Star Wars franchise, so I saw an
                            opportunity and decided to remake Frogger, which originates from 1981, with a Star Wars
                            theme. The art assets are all self-drawn, in PyxelEdit.
